# Discussing nixpkgs bootstrapping

Context: I [asked @Ericson2314](https://matrix.to/#/!djTaTBQyWEPRQxrPTb:nixos.org/$d2x3bCaLGMSjjFLgA3SuSpcvfIU6e_FY6n5KGc7RFQI?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev) whether he'd have time for a call to talk a bit about bootstrapping

- `pkgs/stdenv/generic`: this is what actually makes the stdenv, including defines `mkDerivation`, `setup.sh`, it takes some inputs.

- The other `pkgs/stdenv/*` defines the bootstrapping: many packages sets (aka stages), each of which has their own stdenv) that build upon each other, prior to the final package set (which is not defined here).  

- @infinisil: Which tools specifically are needed by stdenv.mkDerivation?
  - @john: Look at pkgs/stdenv/generic/default.nix
      - Contains `cc` and `shell` arguments
  - @john: There have to be more, sed, patchelf
  - pkgs/stdenv/common-path.nix
    - used as initialPath
- @infinisil: stdenv isn't that important for redesign, let's look at bootstarpping
- @john: Alright let's look at bootstrapping
  - `default.nix`: checks nix version
  - `pkgs/top-level/impure.nix`: fills in default configuration from impure sources (`builtins.currenSystem`, various environment).
  - `pkgs/top-level/default.nix`: starts doing work
      - Specifies local and optional cross platform, complete records not strings
      - Talks about stdenv, but we're not concerned about that
      - `pkgs/stdenv/booter.nix` isn't that important, used for cross and co. so we can delay tying the knot
  - `pkgs/stdenv/default.nix`: picks a chain of stages to bootstrap from
      - Everything except `stagesLinux` and `stagesDarwin` is pretty rotten
 
  - `stagesLinux`:
     - Starts with selecting the bootstrap tools
       - bootstrapp tools are all mixed together FHS style, not separate by purpose nix store style.
       - This is a headache, because it makes it easier later on to accidentally depend on more of the bootstrap tools than we mean to, once we start rebuilding things.
     - @john: There's bootstrap tools and there's a Nix-builtin `sh` (available via `/bin/sh` in the sandbox). We don't need the latter, only bootstrap tools would suffice as bootstrap tools already contains a shell.
     - @infinisil: But bootstrap tools relies on Hydra, how to do proper bootstrapping?
     - @john: Doesn't matter that it's built by Hydra, from Nix it's just a fetch
     - @infinisil: Why do we need this special build by Hydra?
     - @john: We want to control it because it's finnicky
         - Sucks, should have it more like guix.
         - Impure bootstrap sucks.
     - @infinisil: How would a pure bootstrap for nix look like?
     - @john: Same as guix, handrolled asm file, go from there
     - @alyssa: Reuse the one from guix, not sure about how integrated it is
     - @john: Decently integrated
     - @infinisil: If we wanna start from a good foundation we should look at adapting it to Nix
     - @qyliss: Guix is also supportive
     - Sponsors?
     - @infinisil: Guix only seems to support 32bit and 64bit linux for "Reduced Binary Seed Bootstrap" https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Reduced-Binary-Seed-Bootstrap.html
     - @qyliss: Would be the same as stdenv
     - @john: Darwin can continue working like it does now
     - @infinisil: Then let's make it possible to have reduced bootstrap if possible
     - @infinisil: Is it worth looking into reduced bootstrap when we can't get rid of bootstrap tools
     - @qyliss: Never possible to get rid of boostrap tools like this
     - @john: Might be possible. Linux could have open bootstrapping, Darwin might need closed source one, hidden implementation details etc.
     - @john: Could use this binary that runs on all the OSes
     - @john: Don't worry about Darwin
     - @qyliss: Darwin shouldn't hold innovations back
     - @infinisil: What is the shared interface between bootstraps for different platforms?
         - @john: There is no such thing, it depends on the platform, what tools you need on each
     - @infinisil: Are stages important?
         - @qyliss: Stages are a bit like overlays. When we start from nothing, at some point we have to build some packages from e.g. gcc$OLD_VERISON then gcc$NEW_VERSION
         - @infinisil: Could we use the nixpkgs fixed-point for this? E.g. pkgs.gcc6, then build pkgs.gcc7, etc. from that
         - @john: Can be possible. Cross compilation relies more on stages. Version solver
         - @infinisil: Goes into version cleanup in nixpkgs
         - @john: Debian has meta packages, "Need C compiler, don't care which one"
         - @infinisil: How about just doing this untanglinng from stages into nixpkgs fixed-point
         - @john: Makes new packages, leads to combinatory explosion of overrides
         - @qyliss: Less convenient, duplication, somebody needs to maintain the additional packages needed for bootstrapping
     - @infinisil: Let's look at an example, how to bootstrap pkgs.hello?
     - @john: Stages are more easy to understand from the top, from the bottom is hard to see
     - @infinisil: How does one write the stages? Maybe want to compile a C program -> look at latest GCC -> package all dependencies, go from there
     - @john: Could start clean, doing the guix thing, then splicing it into nixpkgs later
     - @john: Stages is useful for different ABI versions
     - @infinisil: Yeah nixpkgs is essentially instantiated multiple times with all the configurations needed, maybe parametrized by stdenv
     - @qyliss: No real consistency for what is stdenv what not. E.g. curses library could be per platform, but not in stdenv
     - @infinisil: What if we have something like `pkgs.abiVersion` and packages use that, then use extra overlays to change it. Maybe expensive?
     - @john: Probably works fine
     - @john: Logic programming language, specify version constraints
       - @infinisil: Separate issue
     - @john: Fixed point vs stages, don't care. Costly is mass rebuilds. Once it builds it's easy to refactor.
     - @john: Stdenv is fairly orthogonal to bootstrapping
  - @Gytis: targetPlatform? Can we get rid of it?
  - @qyliss: Needed for compilers and other things
  - @infinisil: buildPlatform applies to all packages, hostPlatform only applies to things you can run, and targetPlatform only applies to things that builds things that can run
  - @john: If we have to build cross compilers we need to somehow specify the target system
  - @john: We don't want to manually list all targetPlatforms
  - @qyliss: Any package can be target sensitive
  - @john: It's weird that you can `buildDepends` depend on a package that cares what the "next step" should be (is target sensative) when you don't. If you are not targe-sensative your deps should not be either. 
  - @qyliss: Maybe it could make sense to have a restriction of a target-insensitive package not being able to depend on a target-sensitive package
  - @john: +1. Target sensativity "infected" downstream packages re rebuilds, and this should be tightly controlled.
  - @john: responding to others. Againm, just depend on what you need, no need for "stdenv" collection. So don't get confused/mislead by `stdenv.*Platform`, it's just the location where `*Platform` happens to reside today for arbitrary reasons.




@john: Good things come from following: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter
